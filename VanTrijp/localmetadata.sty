\BackTitle{The evolution of case grammar}
\BackBody{There are few linguistic phenomena that have seduced linguists so skillfully as grammatical case has done. Ever since Pāṇini(4th Century BCE),
case has claimed a central role in linguistic theory and continues to do so
today. However, despite centuries worth of research, case has yet to reveal
its most important secrets.

This book offers breakthrough explanations for the understanding of
case through agent-based experiments in cultural language evolution. The
experiments demonstrate that case systems may emerge because they have
a selective advantage for communication: they reduce the cognitive effort
that listeners need for semantic interpretation, while at the same time limiting the cognitive resources required for doing so.}

% therefore offers {\em operational} explanations through experiments in cultural language evolution 
%\citep[see][and other contributions to this volume]{steels-intro}. 
%More specifically, this paper proposes the following answers to the above questions and demonstrates their validity through computational models:

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Case emerges because it has a selective advantage for communication: it reduces the cognitive effort needed for semantic interpretation, while at the same time 
%limiting the required resources for doing so \citep[such as memory space][]{steels05what,steels05linking}.
%\item A population may self-organize a case system if all speakers share a language strategy for case (henceforth called: `case strategy'). Such a strategy 
%comprises components for acquiring, expanding and aligning a case system.
%\item Case markers can be repurposed for a different language system if the original selective advantages of a case system have been `usurped' by 
%more dominant, competing systems in the language.
%\end{enumerate}
